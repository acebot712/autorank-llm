# AutoRank-LLM
Creating a self-stabilizing, fully automated system to evaluate and rank a group of Language Learning Models (LLMs) without human intervention is a complex and intriguing challenge. The key is to design a system where each LLM contributes to the evaluation process, and their influence in this process is adjusted based on their demonstrated abilities. Here’s an out-of-the-box approach:

### Concept: Recursive Peer Review System with Adaptive Weighting

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Start with a group of LLMs, each with an initial arbitrary ranking or skill level, perhaps randomly assigned.

2. **Evaluation Rounds**:
   - In each round, every LLM evaluates the performance of other LLMs. This could be based on specific tasks or questions designed to test various aspects of language understanding and generation.
   - The evaluations are scored, for example, based on coherence, relevance, or creativity of the responses.

3. **Weighted Scoring**:
   - Each LLM’s evaluation of its peers is weighted based on its own current ranking. Higher-ranked LLMs have more influence in evaluating others.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - After each round of evaluations, update each LLM’s ranking based on the weighted scores it received.
   - This step is crucial: The adjustment should be moderate to avoid large swings in rankings and to allow the system to gradually stabilize.

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Incorporate a feedback loop where the system learns which characteristics of evaluations correlate with more effective and consistent ranking outcomes. This could involve machine learning models analyzing patterns in the evaluations and outcomes over multiple rounds.

6. **Normalization and Scaling**:
   - Apply normalization techniques to prevent score inflation or deflation over time.
   - Ensure the ranking scale remains consistent across iterations.

7. **Convergence Criteria**:
   - Define a convergence criterion to determine when the system has stabilized. This could be based on the rate of change in rankings slowing down to a certain threshold.

### Potential Machine Learning Integration:

- **Model Training**: Use a machine learning model to analyze past evaluation data and adjust the weight each LLM’s evaluation carries in future rounds. The model would identify patterns in which evaluations lead to stable and consistent rankings.
- **Continuous Learning**: Allow the system to continuously adapt and refine its weighting strategy based on ongoing evaluation outcomes.

### Challenges and Considerations:

- **Complexity**: This system is complex and would require careful design, especially in crafting the evaluation tasks and interpreting the results.
- **Bias and Echo Chambers**: There's a risk of creating echo chambers where certain types of evaluations are unduly favored. Regular adjustments and checks for such biases are necessary.
- **Computationally Intensive**: This approach could be computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for numerous evaluation rounds and data analysis.

### Conclusion:

This system represents a novel approach to evaluating LLMs in a self-contained and automated manner. While challenging and resource-intensive, it offers a way to dynamically rank LLMs based on their own evaluations of each other, adapting and refining its process over time through a recursive, feedback-driven mechanism.
